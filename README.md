# IP4Bot
An academic advisor chatbot for IF3151 Human Computer Interaction

## Summary
We wish to make an academic self-administration system that is, through our futuristic technologies, administratively superior to the current existing solutions and also improve the current interface status quo to make it more natural to interact with. That interface improvement is creating a chatbot interface that integrates with the administration system so that it can percept and tell information to the user with a natural language, something that doesn’t need a lot of mental efforts to process on. You can picture this product as your personal assistant whose only concern is its employer’s academic life.  
There are 8 clustered functionality that we wish to implement:  
* Class information: helps student know their classes’ information easily without consulting emails or websites.  
* Class attendance: helps class president to check student’s attendance and sends an absent letter if a given student is absent.  
* Homework reminder: helps student not to miss homework and help student align their schedule.  
* Quiz and exam reminder: helps student ensure that they will not miss important quiz and exams.  
* Bad score motivation: helps student prepare the next quiz and exam if they had a bad score.  
* Course recommendation: saving time in class research by providing potential class information based on transcript and interest.  
* Academic regulation: provide information about academic regulation based on the user university’s academic law document.  
* Subject exercise: online standardized testing to test the student’s ability.  

We want to target this product specifically to active undergraduate students that presumably has an internet access whose university already has, or willing to move to, an online administration system.
